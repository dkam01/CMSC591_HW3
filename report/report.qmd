## DELETE THIS SECTION (and subsections) - <br/>KEEP THE REFLECTION SECTION

Besides providing you an opportunity to create a study guide for the quiz, this homework assignment
introduces and reinforces the use of greek letters and \LaTeX formulas within quarto documents.

READ IN DETAIL [EXAMPLE 1](../examples/example-1.html) AND CAREFULLY REVIEW THE [EXAMPLE 1 QMD FILE](../examples/example-1.qmd).

### Approach

* I recommend that you first take [Practice Quiz 3](https://virginiacommonwealth.instructure.com/courses/105097/quizzes/199707) to get
a feel for how I'm testing your knowledge of relational algebra. 

* As you take the practice quiz, I suggest that you take keep notes of what you'd like to have to help you answer a similar question
in the future.

* Convert these notes into a qmd study guide.  Render the qmd to create an HTML file.

* Take the practice quiz again, this time with your study guide.  Did it help?  If not, why?

* Rinse and repeat.

* When you're ready, print a copy of the HTML study guide, then take the real quiz.  You make use a copy of the printed study guide when you take the real quiz 3.

### Getting started with the study guide

If you are struggling to determine what your study guide should look like, I offer a bunch of examples in the *../examples* folder.

A sample scaffold for a study guide table can be found in the [QMD](../examples/example-1.qmd) that created [Example 1](../examples/example-1.html).

### Examples

To provide you with a boatload of examples, I assembled the files in the *../examples* folder.

* [Example 1](../examples/example-1.html) - contains references, sample symbols, and a scaffold for a study guide that you might find useful.

* [Example 2](../examples/example-2.html) - this is an example document using $\LaTeX$ formulas in a quarto QMD file.

* [Example 3](../examples/example-3.html) - this document contains a proof for the Pythagorean Theorem.

* [Example 4](../examples/example-4.html) - this document contains a proof for the commutativity of the selection and join operators.

## Reflection

Please keep the reflection section at the bottom of your study guide and answer these questions:

1. Would you /how would you approach this assignment differently in the future?

1. What was the most surprising (good or bad) thing that you learned by doing this assignment?

1. How much time did you spend on this assignment?

1. What CS classes have you had (or have now) that the quarto math expressions and diagrams (e.g., graphviz and mermaid) would have made it easier?
